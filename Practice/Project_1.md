## Main Requirements

Create a game app for either Android or iOS (choose one) that generates random instructions the user must follow using standard on-screen UI components (e.g., text and password fields, toggles, buttons, sliders) to "disarm" an imaginary bomb. If the user follows all instructions correctly, the bomb is disarmed and an appropriate success state (e.g., a congratulatory image) is shown. If the user fails any instruction, the bomb "explodes" and a failure/game-over state (e.g., a failure image) is shown. From either state, it must be possible to restart the game, restoring controls and generating a new random set of instructions.

Your app MUST include at least the following UI components on iOS:

* `TextField`
* `SecureField`
* `Button`
* `Toggle`
* `Stepper`
* `Slider`

Your app MUST include at least the following UI components on Android:

* `TextField`
* `TextField` configured for password input
* `Button`
* `Switch`
* `RadioButton`
* `Checkbox`
* `Slider`

Your app SHOULD incorporate as many modern language features as are reasonable, as outlined on the official language sites or in our lecture [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPbaxzOqFTg&list=PLHcEzCb_lW6elkSLGb_XTw9BDNsksy887&index=7).

In addition:

* The app should be of acceptable visual quality.
* The app should work in portrait and landscape modes. Ensure it is possible to scroll through the UI where needed.
* You don't have to target tablets or foldables, but on common phone screen sizes all UI elements must lay out and behave correctly.
* Use at least two images for success/failure (or other appropriate) states: one vector and one raster. Raster images must scale appropriately (or be of native resolution) on both small and large phone screens.

## Bonus Opportunities

Be creative and add as many additional features as you can within the time limits. You may use AI tools to generate code. However, you MUST understand and be able to explain any generated code; we may ask during the defense.

## Defense

Do not submit code unless requested. You will defend your project during midterm exam week (in the first or second class session, selected at random by the instructors). When called upon, share your screen from your own computer, demonstrate the app running (an emulator or simulator is fine), show the code, and answer questions about the app and its implementation to receive your grade.

## Grading

You can earn up to 40 points. This practice covers the first two labs in the Syllabus and the Midterm Exam.

* The program functions correctly: 15 points
* The code is of acceptable quality and uses many modern programming language features: 10 points
* The program works on different phone screens and in both portrait and landscape modes: 10 points
* The defense is delivered successfully, and all questions are answered: 5 points
