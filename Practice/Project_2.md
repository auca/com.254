=======================

## Main Requirements

Create an integrated solution consisting of a hardware system represented by an ESP-32 or other similar prototyping board with at least one connected sensor, and a software system represented by at least a mobile application for Android or iOS to at least present the sensor data in a user friendly way.

This is an open project. You have complete freedom to decide which system to build. During the course we will present you several possible ideas that you can pursue. The minimum is to build a system that allows to consume sensor data through some popular networking protocol by a mobile application of you writing from an ESP32 board. Aside from that, you can decide which sensor or sensors to use, how to send, store, and consume data, and how present it in your mobile app. Use you best judgment, ensure that even though the system is a prototype, it still present something usefull for some particular audience.

## Bonus Opportunities

Be creative and add as many additional features as you can within the time limits. You may use AI tools to generate code. However, you MUST understand and be able to explain any generated code; we may ask during the defense.

## Defense

Do not submit code unless requested. You will defend your project during final exam week (in the first, second, or third class session). The signup form is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17U_gv1juwp6Hsk5mOOc8Em264NkVASKWge75mNhdBMk).

When called upon, share your screen from your own computer, show the hardware system with your phone camera, demonstrate the app running (an emulator or simulator is fine), show the code, and answer questions about the app and its implementation to receive your grade.

## Grading

You can earn up to 60 points. This practice covers the second two labs in the Syllabus and the Course Project with the Final Exam.

* The hardware systems functions correctly: 15 points
* The software systems functions correctly: 15 points
* Both system are integrated and function together: 10 points
* The defense is delivered successfully, and all questions are answered: 15 points
* The code is of acceptable quality and uses many modern programming language features: 5 points
